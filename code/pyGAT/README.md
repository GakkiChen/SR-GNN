# Pytorch Graph Attention Network

This is a pytorch implementation of the Graph Attention Network (GAT)
model presented by Veličković et. al (2017, https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903).

This work is forked from: https://github.com/Diego999/pyGAT. We experimented with the pyGAT model with our visual features extracted from various object detection backends.

# Requirements

pyGAT relies on Python 3.5 and PyTorch 0.4.1 (due to torch.sparse_coo_tensor).
